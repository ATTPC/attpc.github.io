GETDAQ is used to control the MuTaNT/CoBo/AsAd/AGET  electronics, as well as readout data from the electronics. GETDAQ was developed by the  GET collaboration.</li> <li>FRIBDAQ/NSCLDAQ: The data acquisition library used for  auxiliary detectors in the AT-TPC scheme. FRIBDAQ is a general use data acquisition  library that supports many different module types. FRIBDAQ/NSCLDAQ is developed by the  FRIB Data Acquisition Group.</li> <li>attpc_envoy: A Rust-based interface for the  GETDAQ system. GETDAQ provides the server/client infrastructure for controlling the  GET electronics, but doesn't provide a complete interface for those controls.  attpc_envoy is an eframe/egui GUI with an  asynchronous backend which monitors and manipulates the state of all of the  independent GETDAQ systems. The repository for attpc_envoy can be found  here. attpc_envoy is actively developed and  used by the AT-TPC Group and collaborators.</li> <li>attpc_merger: A Rust-based event building  software for AT-TPC data. The various data acquisition components of the AT-TPC  generate many separate data files of incompatible formats with chunks of data from  different detector components. attpc_merger takes these data files and merges the data  into a unified (time-based) event structure. attpc_merger serves as a conversion step,  preparing data for analysis by tools like Spyral and ATTPCROOT.

Spyral supports massively-parallel analysis and  uses advanced techniques such as Just-In-Time compilation to achieve competitive  performance with other frameworks on this list. Spyral is actively developed and used  by the AT-TPC group and collaborators. The Spyral repository can be found  here as well. Some useful Spyral tools are  described in the utilities section.</li> <li>ATTPCROOT: ATTPCROOT is a  ROOT-based framework to analyze data of active target detectors  including the ATTPC (Active Target Time Projection Chamber) detector and the p-ATTPC  (Prototype). The framework allows the end user to unpack and analyze the data, as well  as perform realistic simulations based on a Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC) package. The  framework needs external libraries (FairSoft and FairRoot)  to be compiled and executed, which are developed by other groups and not directly  supported by the AT-TPC Group. Documentation for ATTPCROOT can be found  here. ATTPCROOT is actively used  throughout the AT-TPC collaboration.</li> <li>attpc_engine: A Python Monte Carlo  simulation framework developed alongside Spyral. attpc_engine allows for the  calculation of multi-step reaction kinematics and the simulation AT-TPC detector  effects over that kinematics sample. Engine data can then be given to Spyral to test  the efficiency of both the detector and the analysis.

AT-TPC datasets can be several terabytes, and cost a lot of time to run even  in a parallel environment. To overcome this limitation, AT-TPC has requested time on the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility's (ALCF) Polaris high-performance computing environment and successfully deployed Spyral to this system. Below are the steps necessary to run  your analysis at ALCF.</p>"},{"location":"software/polaris/#get-some-compute-hours","title":"Get some compute hours","text":"<p>First and foremost, you need some compute hours from the Polaris facility. There are a few options; if you are a memeber of the FRIB AT-TPC group, we have an allocation already and you should reach out to Daniel Bazin for access to that allocation. If you are a collaborator, you can request an allocation for your group from the ALCF website. Either way, you will also need an account to log into the ALCF system, which again you can create at the ALCF site. </p>"},{"location":"software/polaris/#manage-your-data","title":"Manage your data","text":"<p>With hours on an ALCF machine, the next task is to get your data from a local disk onto the ALCF systems. ALCF systems use Globus, which is a data transfer and management system for science. You can create a Globus account, and should check if your institution has a license (the license allows you to access more advanced features). You can then use Globus to transfer your data to your allocation on the ALCF systems.</p>"},{"location":"software/polaris/#harmonizing-your-data","title":"Harmonizing your data","text":"<p>Generally, AT-TPC's unit of compute work is a single data file in HDF5 format. We can only parallelize up to the number of files your data is stored in i.e., if you have 5 files the maximum amount of parallelization is 5 cores. Raw data is stored in units of what we call \"runs\". Each run is typically an hour or so of data taken with the TPC. However, this is not ideal when running in high-performance environments. A hour of data does not mean each file contains the same amount of data, for various experimental reasons. This means that one of your parallel work units might complete much earlier than the others, resulting in inefficient use of resources and longer total runtimes.</p> <p>To combat this, you should utilize the harmonizer. The harmonizer allows you to reformat the data files to be a uniform size in terms of bytes. It also allows you to divide your data into more files, allowing you to perform more analysis in parallel, and take advantage of all of the resources at your disposal.</p>"},{"location":"software/polaris/#at-tpc-group-users","title":"AT-TPC Group Users","text":"<p>At FRIB, we have access to a local Globus endpoint where you can store your data and transfer to Argonne using the high-speed network.

These post-Spyral analyses should not be run on systems like Polaris. In particular, running notebooks like spyral_notebooks is not a good idea on systems like Polaris; they will count against your allocation hours and cost you money! You should copy your output files from Spyral from Polaris to a local machine/workstation where you can run this downstream analysis without needing to pay for compute hours. Again, you can use Globus to facilitate this transfer of data.</p>"},{"location":"software/utilities/","title":"Software Utilities","text":"<p>These are tools which are supplementary to the data acqusition and the analysis.</p> <ul> <li>spyral_notebooks This is a repository  of Jupyter notebooks that can be used to examine the Spyral analysis pipeline step by  step.
